DESCRIPTION:



My project is simple: It is a website, with therefore HTML, CSS and Javascript,
which aims to open the eyes to people about our climate.



My project consists of 2 pages:
the first shows us the atrocities made by humans on earth: factories, cars, plastic, etc.
And on the other hand, shows us the beauty of our planet.

The second page shows us some personalities
who support the cause like Leonardo DiCaprio or Emma Watson and shows how they act against climate deregulation
and their social networks are mentioned to get people to follow them.

I find that the problem is not taken seriously enough... And I want to change that.
People roam the internet a lot and that's why I decided to create my website. To reason with them,
to encourage them to follow public figures who are for ecology and thus, to get things done!

I would also like to create a section to make donations and make them to associations.
The big companies do nothing ... so I take action!

So, Javascript was mainly used on the first page, to create all the animations that you can see at the very beginning.
HTML was mainly used for the structure of the page while CSS was used for the design.

The first page is divided into 3 categories:
the first is reception. When you enter the site, this is the first thing you see. Then there is the content with smooth images and texts.
And finally, come the footer with all the contacts and social networks of the website.

The second and last page has only 2 categories: the first is content. Public figures are shown, their actions, words, photos are shown.
3 personalities are shown. their social networks are also mentioned and redirect directly to their official pages.
This will make it easier for people to get interested in the subject.
And finally, also come the footer and all that there is with it.

The design of the two pages is different and this is voluntary. Thus, with this change of design,
the site will capture their attention and this is very important when a subject like ecology is broached!



Well, that's as simple as that ! But I plan,
thereafter, to expand my site and make it public! I hope you like my project !! - Dagaiev Adam, from Belgium.
